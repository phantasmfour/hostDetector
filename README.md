# hostDetector
Check Hosts on My Subnets

Basically a short script to check if new hosts are on my subnets and send them to Discord. 
Has a few other features like:
* Scans a hardcoded list of networks
* Resolves DNS on all of them
* Get the MAC Address
* Check if it is in a whitelist of no alert MACs
* Check if we already found these exact hosts
* Send the results to Discord
